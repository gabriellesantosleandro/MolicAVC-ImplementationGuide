If the enableWhen.question has multiple answers, the condition evaluates to true if *any* of the answers for the referenced item match the enableWhen condition.  This element is a modifier because if enableWhen is present for an item, ""required"" is ignored unless one of the enableWhen conditions is met.

In some cases, the comparison between the indicated answer and the specified value may differ only by precision.  For example, the enableWhen might be Q1 > 1970, but the answer to Q1 is 1970-10-15.  There is not a clear answer as to whether 1970-10-15 should be considered 'greater' than 1970, given that it is an imprecise value.

If the form **is** displayed, items where enableWhen is indeterminate SHOULD be treated as enabled with a warning indicating that the questionnaire logic was faulty and it is possible that the item should not be enabled.
